# pokemon go afk
generate timestamps for gpx files, allowing you to use xcode + gps spoofing to go anywhere

Usage:
ruby pokemongoafk.rb -s [speed] [gpx file] [output file]

Notes:
- The XML parsing was only tested against GPX files generated @ http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/draw/
- Speed can be any value, just note that I was temporarily banned for teleporting to the UK, so my suggestion is to use something a little realistic. Plus, you don't get credit for eggs if you set this too high. The average running speed for an adult male is 2.7.

Happy hunting!
